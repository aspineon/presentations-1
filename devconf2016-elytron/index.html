## Are you ready for a new WildFly security? 

# Elytron!

???

Welcome to the last presentation today. 

It's cool to see audience even in such a late time.

The presentation is be about project Elytron,
new security subsystem for WildFly.

The excellent WildFly 10 was released before one week without Elytron.
So you still have a time to prepare for the changes coming in next versions!

I always wanted to have a slide with disclaimer in my presentation. I love the second slide
in presentation of Oracle employees, so I made one too.

The Elytron is not yet in WildFly and many of things can change 
or evolve in different ways until it will be fully integrated.

## Agenda

* Conclusion
* Icebreakers
* Problems we solve
* Features we have
* Future we define
* Backward compatible are we?
* Demo time

???

This is my plan for this presentation:

* let's start with conclusion, because I have to catch a classical music concert at 7:30
* then it's a good practice to include some icebreakers in the presentation, so let's do it too
* we'll shortly talk about background of this change, **WHY it's important?**
* current state of the project, i.e **WHAT we have**
* and let's also talk about our (or my) expectations - **WHERE the Elytron will go in next days and months?**
* the expectations also cover expected problems we'll see once the Elytron in WildFly is live
* And finally, let's try some live demo.

---

## Elytron Summary - Conclusion

* set of APIs and SPIs
* unified security configuration
* SASL based authentication
* supports new security approaches and mechanisms

*WildFly Elytron is a new WildFly sub-project which is **completely replacing** the combination of **PicketBox and JAAS** as the WildFly client and server security mechanism.*

???

Elytron Wildfly is set of APIs and SPIs which cover application server security.

It unifies the security configuration accross the application server. It will resolve the fragmentation in security configuration. (for instance SSL configuration)

Elytron announcement from David LLoyd on WildFly-dev mailing list in June 2014.

## Who is Josef Cacek?

* Red Hatter - Principal Quality Engineer in JBoss EAP team
  * security
  * containers
  * clouds  
* father
* hobby runner
* organ player

???

This is my background info. I work in Red Hat as a JBoss quality engineer
 focused mainly on security and in last months also on containers and clouds.

Other roles, I play more-or-less succesfully are happy father, experienced hobby runner and organ player.

# What about you?

???

Aaaand now the social part.... the icebreakers
---

# What about you?

* Do you work with Java application servers?

???

Are you Java EE friends? 

Raise your hands, please.
---

# What about you?

* Do you work with Java application servers?
* Have you ever tried to change some security configuration in WildFly?

???

Have you ever met security domains, realms, or SSL configuration in WildFly?

---

# What about you?

* Do you work with Java application servers?
* Have you ever tried to change some security configuration in WildFly?
* Do you run?

???

And Mathew in the Bible says something like: "Man shall not live on WildFly alone"


So now the runners, my friends, raise your hands and inspire/enthuse the rest of this group for this great religion.

## Problems we solve

* JAAS limitations
  * Subject performance
  * not standardized in Java EE
* need for stronger authentication
* fragmented security configuration in subsystems
  * security domains
  * security realms
  * vaults
  * subsystems with their own configuration

???

The icebreakers part is succesfully completed, let's continue with more serious business.

**"Why are we replacing current solution?"**

Let's dive into a history little bit.

* JAAS is actually a client side API that pre-dated Java EE
* JEE specs left security decisions down to the vendors
* only simple security solutions were in demand at that time (validate plain text username and password). As a result JAAS was quickly adopted as this was something it could do.
* with JBoss AS7 preference was to switch to stronger authentication mechanisms - which meant SASL based authentication, which was not compatible with JAAS
* as a result we have 2 different security solutions (one focussed on SASL compatibility and one focussed on the legacy approach of principal / credential validation with integration between the two)
* having 2 different security solutions solving the same problem from completely different perspectives is confusing for user
* this led to the initiation of the Elytron project to provide a single unified security solution across the whole application server.

It was beginning of 2013, when David LLoyd wrote about a need of uniform way
how to handle security context propagation. He described limitations which
came from using JAAS Subject-based approach in WildFly.

## Features we have

**Elytron**
* Password Factory
* Security Realm
* Security Domain
* SASL Mechanisms
* HTTP Authentication Framework
* JACC
* JCA Providers support

**Subsystems integration** (*Work in Progress*)
* Undertow
* EJBs

???

PasswordFactory API/SPI
* Implementation of numerous password types and representations (hashed / salted)
* Mechanism specific representations e.g. Digest/SCRAM/OTP
* Some level of transformation

Security Realms - Integration point with account store
* when we simplify it: validate credentials, retrieve them from backing store, modify credentials
* implementations: Legacy properties file, JDBC, LDAP, File based
* Also have modifiable realm API/SPI

Security Domain - Authentication Starts Against This
* Aggregation of security realms
* Returns SecurityIdentity (getRoles based on RoleMapper, getPermissions based on PermissionMapper)

SASL Mechanisms (Based on JBoss SASL)  
HTTP Authentication Framework - SASL pattern for HTTP

```java
public WildFlyElytronProvider() {
    putHttpAuthenticationMechanismImplementations();
    putKeyStoreImplementations();
    putPasswordImplementations();
    putSaslMechanismImplementations();
}
```
---

## Features we have 

### WildFly Security Manager

* present in WildFly already

```bash
$WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -secmgr
```

???

WildFly Security Manager which is already present in WF, can be seen also
as part of Elytron effort.

It has its own subsystem.

---
## Subsystems comparison

* `/subsystem=security`
  * XSD - 424 lines
  * subsystem resource description - 1286 lines
* `/subsystem=elytron`
  * XSD - 2387 lines
  * subsystem resource description - 3256 lines

???

We can compare the legacy security subsystem and new elytron one (which is not finished yet).

From this simple comparison, we'll see the configuration will surely cover large area.

The XML Schema file of Elytron subsystem has 5-times more lines than  security subsystem.
---

## Subsystems comparison - Legacy Security subsystem

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:security:3.0">
  <security-domains>
    <security-domain name="myDomain" cache-type="default">
      <authentication>
        <login-module code="UsersRoles" flag="default">
          <module-option name="usersProperties" 
                         value="/etc/wf-users.properties" />
          <module-option name="rolesProperties" 
                         value="/etc/wf-roles.properties" />
        </login-module>
      </authentication>
    </security-domain>
</subsystem>
```
???
Standard form of configuration in legacy subsystem
* named security domain which can be referenced from deployed applications and used for controlling authentication and authorization
* it contains one or more login modules which are usually responsible for authentication and role mapping
---
## Subsystems comparison - Elytron subsystem

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:wildfly:elytron:1.0">
  <security-domains>
    <security-domain name="testdomain" default-realm="fsRealm">
      <realm name="fsRealm" />
    </security-domain>
  </security-domains>
  <security-realms>
    <filesystem-realm name="fsRealm">
      <file path="fs-realm" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir" />
    </filesystem-realm>
  </security-realms>
  <http>
    <http-server-authentication name="server-authn" 
             http-server-factory="global" security-domain="testdomain">
      <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="BASIC">
          <mechanism-realm realm-name="Secured by Elytron" />
        </mechanism>
      </mechanism-configuration>
    </http-server-authentication>
    <provider-http-server-factory name="global" />
  </http>
</subsystem>
```
???
Elytron subsystem has to contain much more stuff
* we have analogy to login modules and legacy domains in Elytron security realms and domains
* but to get it working with WildFly web server Undertow you have to define also HTTP authentication
* We can expect that default server configuration will contain reasonable defaults for the HTTP authn
---
## Future we define

* Credential Store
* Single SSL/TLS configuration place
* Subsystems integration (Remoting, JMS, ...)

???

Credential Store API/SPI
* replacement for security vaults
  * store sensitive information out of the server configuration
  * for instance DB passwords
* probably with tooling to convert existing vaults
* more instances in one configuration

Single SSL/TLS
* Currently several places where SSL is configured
  * domains
  * realms
  * Undertow

There will be a need for integration work in other subsystems like Remoteing, Messaging, and others.
Thanks to new feature in WildFly 10, which is called capabilities and requirements, there will hopefully be no need 
for direct dependency on Elytron.
---

## Backward compatibility

**Compatibility level is not clear at this moment!**

Terminology is not compatible already (Domains and Realms).

Probably:
* old and new systems will live together (for some time);
* only LoginModules will survive (afterwards);
* migration tool for vaults will be introduced.

???

And now the real speculations.

Once the Elytron is merged to WF, users will start to ask
* if it's compatible with legacy solution.
* how to convert existing configuration to Elytron
* what will happen with custom authentication modules developed by users

 
---

## Demo time - Securing web application

**Demo app**
* single JSP with declarative security in web.xml

**Legacy way configuration**
* Authentication through legacy security domain
  * property file

**Elytron way configuration**
* Authentication through Elytron security domain
  * FileSystem Realm
* HTTP authentication configuration
* Undertow configuration

???
And now the demo time.

I will use WildFly 10 from Elytron integration branch to show you how to do HTTP authentication
with Elytron.

We'll cover securing a simple web-application.

We'll start with showing legacy solution and then switching to Elytron.

* legacy domain
* test app

* HTTP authentication in Undertow web server
 * extension and subsystem
 * realm and domain
 * HTTP authentication
 * Undertow
 * deploy and run test app
 
---

## Demo time - Add Security provider

* add SunPKCS11 provider through Elytron subsystem
  * standard way to deal with keys on crypto devices like smart-cards, USB tokens, NSS keystores

???

Escape-7 x

Second demo will show other part of Elytron configuration.

We will add support for PKCS11 keystore type by adding SunPKCS11 security provider.

The PKCS11 keystores can be used to deal with crypto devices like smart cards and USB crypto-tokens.

In my case I don't have such a device now, so I'll bind it to Netscape Security Services
keystore type, which is available through libnss3 library and has support in SunPKCS11 security
provider.

## Elytron Summary - Conclusion

* set of APIs and SPIs
* unified security configuration
* SASL based authentication
* supports new security approaches and mechanisms

*WildFly Elytron is a new WildFly sub-project which is **completely replacing** the combination of **PicketBox and JAAS** as the WildFly client and server security mechanism.*
