WildFly Elytron [1] is a new WildFly sub-project which will completely 
replace the combination of PicketBox and JAAS as the WildFly client and 
server security mechanism.

An "elytron" (ĕl´·ĭ·trŏn, plural "elytra") is the hard, protective 
casing over a wing of certain flying insects (e.g. beetles).

Here is a high-level project summary:

WildFly Elytron does presently, or will, satisfy the following goals:

• Establish and clearly define terminology around WildFly's security 
concepts
• Provide support for secure server-side authentication mechanisms (i.e. 
eliminating the historical "send the password everywhere" style of 
authentication and forwarding) supporting HTTP [2], SASL [3] (including 
SASL+GSSAPI [4]), and TLS [5] connection types, as well as supporting 
other authentication protocols in the future without change (such as 
RADIUS [6], GSS [7], EAP [8])
• Provide a simple means to support multiple security associations per 
security context (one per authentication system, including local and 
remote application servers, remote databases, remote LDAP, etc.)
• Provide support for password credential types using the standard JCE 
archetypal API structure (including but not limited to plain, UNIX 
DES/MD5/SHA crypt types, bcrypt, mechanism-specific pre-hashed 
passwords, etc.)
• Provide SPIs to support all of the above, such that consumers such as 
Undertow, JBoss SASL, HornetQ etc. can use them directly with a minimum 
of integration overhead
• Provide SPIs to support and maintain security contexts
• Integrate seamlessly with PicketLink IDM and Keycloak projects
• Provide SPIs to integrate with IDM systems (such as PicketLink) as 
well as simple/local user stores (such as KeyStores or plain files, and 
possibly also simple JDBC and/or LDAP backends as well)
• Provide SPIs to support name rewriting and realm selection based on 
arbitrary, pluggable criteria
• Provide a Remoting-based connection-bound authentication service to 
establish or forward authentication between systems
• Provide SPIs to allow all Remoting-based protocols to reuse/share 
security contexts (EJB, JNDI, etc.)
• Integrate seamlessly with Kerberos authentication schemes for all 
authentication mechanisms (including inbound and outbound identity 
propagation for all currently supporting protocols)
• Provide improved integration with EE standards (JAAC and JASPIC)

The following are presently non- or anti-goals:

• Any provision to support JAAS Subject as a security context (due to 
performance and correctness concerns)†
• Any provision to support JAAS LoginContext (due to tight integration 
with Subject)
• Any provision to maintain API compatibility with PicketBox (this is 
not presently an established requirement and thus would add undue 
implementation complexity, if it is indeed even possible)
• Replicate Kerberos-style ticket-based credential forwarding (just use 
Kerberos in this case)

† You may note that this is in contrast with a previous post to the AS 7 
list [9] in which I advocated simply unifying on Subject.  Subsequent 
research uncovered a number of performance and implementation weaknesses 
in JAAS that have since convinced the security team that we should no 
longer be relying on it.

Most of the discussion on this project happens in the #wildfly-dev+ 
(note the plus sign) channel on FreeNode IRC.  At some point in the 
near-ish future I will hopefully also have some (open-source) 
presentation materials about the architecture.

Questions and comments welcome; feel free to peruse the code and comment 
in GitHub as well.
